I think that cloning and tinkering with some of the [Starter Projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) listed in the docs is perhaps the best way of learning Eleventy. Or if you don't want to clone them, then have a nosey around their insides in the Github repos â€“ there's always something to learn from their `.eleventy.js` config files. 

They come in all flavours and sizes, but some are more beginner-friendly than others. Even those that have the same features (like Tailwind) implement them slightly differently.

Here's a few places you might want to start:

1. [The 11ty base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) I guess this is as close as you get to an 'official starter project' as it is created by Zach himself. It's saved as a template so you can hit that green button and make a copy directly in your Github account.

2. [jet(just eleventy and tailwind)](https://github.com/marcamos/jet) This is the starter theme I used for this site as I wanted to try out using Tailwind on a production site. It's pretty straighforward and I think that if you understand all the articles in here then you will be able to figure out how the jet project works.

3. [eleventastic](https://github.com/maxboeck/eleventastic/blob/master/.eleventy.js) Again this one is quite straightforward. I admire Max's other work and I used this starter for one of the first sites I built.

4. Steph's [11ty Netlify Jumpstart](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/) If you're looking for something a bit less barebones and want to customise something that already looks great out-of-the-box, then have a look at Steph's SASS based theme. Steph's super-talented and her https://11ty.rocks site is a must-bookmark if you're learning Eleventy.

5. Andy Bell's [Hylia](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) project is similarly ready to go. Although it seems to have been archived now, it's worth looking into how the SASS and CSS is setup, and it's also a good example of connecting to Netlify CMS.
