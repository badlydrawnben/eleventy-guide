<p class="text-center font-semibold"><span class="text-5xl">WARNING</span><br>
<p class="text-center font-semibold">This website is aimed at people like me who are crap at Javascript and/or haven't used Static Site Generators before. If that's not you then you'll likely find the content to be patronising and oversimplistic!</p></div>    

## Fun with JAM and Eleventy
JAMstack (**J**avascript **A**PIs & **M**arkdown) sites can be fun, quick to build, cheap (in fact often free) to host, they scale well and have few security worries.

[Eleventy](#https://11ty.dev) is a popular and simple Static Site Generator (SSG). It feels like a good one to choose beacuse it has a mimimal setup and you don't need to know another library like React, Go or another lanaguage like Ruby. 

[The official Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) are good, but I think they do assume some knowledge of how SSGs work (many people seem to migrate to Eleventy from other SSGs like Gatsby) and/or they assume a certain familiarity with Javascript. As a newcomer I found that a lot of the content went 'over my head'. I needed more of an *Idiot's guide to Eleventy* â€“ so I decided to be the idiot to write it.

This site is meant to capture what I've learnt whilst exploring and building with Eleventy. Its purpose is primarily a reference tool for my future self (who is prone to making the same mistake over and again!) but I hope it will help to lower the entry barrier so more people can join in the Eleventy fun.
 

## About me
I'm coming to the JAMstack and SSG world from a background in WordPress. I don't have any programming qualifications/training and I'm self-taught in the fairly basic PHP and jQuery that you need to build straightforward 'brochure' style WordPress sites. I'm good with HTML and CSS, albeit that I tend to lean on Bootstrap quite a lot.

I like WordPress and make a living from it. But it stopped being *fun* a long time ago. I wanted to get back to the basics of writing code and building sites for the pleasure of it. 

## Sites I've built
Weird ones like this, ones for my little boy's latest interest (and an introduction to Netlify CMS), this one.
