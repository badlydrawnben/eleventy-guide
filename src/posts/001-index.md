Basic JAMstack (**J**avascript **A**PIs & **M**arkdown) sites are fun, quick to build, cheap (in fact often free) to host, they scale well and have few security worries.

[Eleventy](#https://11ty.dev)(11ty) is a popular and simple Static Site Generator (SSG). It's good for beginners because it has a mimimal setup and you don't need to know another Javascript library like React or another programming language like Ruby. 

[The official Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) are good, but I think they do assume some knowledge of how SSGs work (many people seem to migrate to Eleventy from other SSGs like Gatsby) and/or they assume a certain familiarity with Javascript. As a newcomer I found that a lot of the content went 'over my head'. I needed more of an *Idiot's guide to Eleventy* – so I decided to be the idiot to write it.
 

## How to get started?
There are plenty '*learning Eleventy by following along as we build a site from scratch*' tutorials and videos that will show you how to install and set up an Eleventy site from a blank folder. Whilst I think these are useful, for me personally I found that I learned more and found it less frustrating when I cloned one or two of the [starter projects listed in the Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) and tinkered around with them. 

See the [Starter projects](/starter-projects) page for some suggestions for newbie-friendly projects amongst the long list on the Eleventy site.

This site is intended as the 'missing manual' for beginners – which you can come back and refer to when you get stuck or confused by following other tutorials or looking at the code in other Eleventy projects.

## Go and have fun
One of the things I like about Eleventy and Netlify (and Tailwind too) is that you can have fun making experimental and niche websites really easily. They have no hosting cost and they're no-maintenance. You can make one in an hour and it'll live safely and securely on the internet without ever needing any software or server updates.

## About me
I'm coming to the JAMstack and SSG world from a background in WordPress. I don't have any programming qualifications/training and I'm self-taught in the fairly basic HTML, CSS, PHP and jQuery that you can build a WordPress site with.

I like WordPress, but it stopped being *fun* a long time ago. I wanted to get back to the basics of writing code and building sites for the pleasure of it. 

I'm still experimenting with Eleventy so my portfolio is rather pathetic. But I've made quirky sites like https://badlydrawnben.com and throwaway ones *with* and *for* my kids – like this one about [World War 2 aeroplanes](https://ww2planes.netlify.app). 

## Feedback
Feel free to open an issue in the [Github repo](https://github.com/badlydrawnben/eleventy-guide) or create a pull request - that's probably the easiest way of pointing out any errors or asking for clarification if I haven't explained something very well. 

## Join the community
You can ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charitybiscuits) if you're stuck trying to do something really basic. But we're both in trouble if I'm the expert because I'm still a complete novice myself! The [Eleventy Discord server](https://www.11ty.dev/news/discord/) is full of developers, 99.5% of whom are better at Eleventy than me, so that's a good place to go for help.
