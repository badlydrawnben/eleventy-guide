## Fun with JAM and Eleventy
JAMstack (**J**avascript **A**PIs & **M**arkdown) sites can be fun, quick to build, cheap (in fact often free) to host, they scale well and have few security worries.

[Eleventy](#https://11ty.dev) is a popular and simple Static Site Generator (SSG). It's good for beginners because it has a mimimal setup and you don't need to know another library like React or another lanaguage like Ruby. 

[The official Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) are good, but I think they do assume some knowledge of how SSGs work (many people seem to migrate to Eleventy from other SSGs like Gatsby) and/or they assume a certain familiarity with Javascript. As a newcomer I found that a lot of the content went 'over my head'. I needed more of an *Idiot's guide to Eleventy* – so I decided to be the idiot to write it.

There are some good video walkthroughs available on how to set up an Eleventy site from scratch. They'll give you a great overview of how things work. I haven't laid this out as a '*learning Eleventy by following along as we build a site*' because there's plenty people who can do that better than me. This is intended as the 'missing manual' which you can come back and refer to when you get stuck or confused by following other tutorials or looking at the code in other Eleventy projects.
 
## About me
I'm coming to the JAMstack and SSG world from a background in WordPress. I don't have any programming qualifications/training and I'm self-taught in the fairly basic PHP and jQuery that you need to build straightforward 'brochure' style WordPress sites. I'm good with HTML and CSS, albeit that I tend to lean on Bootstrap quite a lot.

I like WordPress and make a living from it. But it stopped being *fun* a long time ago. I wanted to get back to the basics of writing code and building sites for the pleasure of it. 

I'm still experimenting with Eleventy so my portfolio is rather pathetic. But I've made quirky sites like https://badlyrawnben.com and throwaway ones *with* and *for* my kids – like this one about [World War 2 aeroplanes](https://ww2planes.netlify.app). 

## Go and have fun
One of the things I like about Eleventy and Netlify (and Tailwind too) is that you can have fun making experimental and niche websites really easily. They have no hosting cost and they're no-maintenance. You can make one in an hour and it'll live safely and securely on the internet without ever needing any software or server updates.

## How to get started?
There are plenty 'from scratch' tutuorials and videos that will show you how to install and set up an Eleventy site from a blank folder. Whilst I think these are useful, for me personally I found that I learned more and found it less frustrating when I cloned one or two of the [starter projects listed in the Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) and tinkered around with them. This site will hopefully be a useful companion if you choose to go down that route. See my Starter projects page for some suggestions for newbie-friendly projects amongst the long list on the Eleventy site.

## Feedback
Feel free to open an issue in the Github repo - that's probably the easiest way of pointing out any errors or asking for clarification if I haven't explained something very well. 

## Join the community
You can ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charitybiscuits) if you're stuck trying to do something really basic. But we're both in trouble if I'm the expert because I'm still a complete novice myself! The Eleventy Discord channel is full of developers, 99.5% of whom are better at Eleventy than me, so that's a good place to go for help.
