## Can you use Eleventy if you're crap at Javascript?
Whilst Eleventy is a Javascript-based SSG, you really don't need to know *a ton* of JS in order to get going. There are plenty [Starter Projects](/starter-projects) you can pick from which are fairly basic, and then get something up and running very quickly without needing to poke around under the hood.

If you're new to SSGs and the JAMstack then there is a bit of a learning curve. Eleventy is deliberately barebones and unopinionated – that's what developers like about it. But as a newbie you don't have many opinions of your own so it can seem a bit daunting. 

My own Javascript skills are embarrasingly bad, and in WordPress land I've managed for years to get by with a bit of jQuery knowldege and a lot of time searching StackOverflow.

## Learning Javascript online
I've been trying to brush up on my skills recently. For what it's worth I've found [Wes Bos' Beginner Javascript](https://wesbos.com/courses) course to be good. And [this course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/learn/lecture/9873008#overview) too.

One of the things that held me back for so many years was that I would try and learn the theory but never had many opportunities to put it into practice. Learning Eleventy is a good way of doing that. I'm working my way through the [Edabit challenges](https://edabit.com/) too – they're free and I've found them to be really useful.

## Do you have to learn NodeJS as well?
You do definitely need to know the basics of [Node.js](/node-js-basics) – but that might only be a few commands to install packages and understand what `module.exports` is all about.

And to look on the bright side – at least you don't need to learn PHP, MySQL and Apache in order to be a supreme JAMstack developer!

## Can you use jQuery with Eleventy sites?
Yes of course. Although it's perhaps a bit of an outdated framework these days and you may well not need to load 60kb or so of framework just to get a dropdown menu to work. Once you start obsessing over getting a perfect score in the [11ty Leaderboards](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/) then you'll probably want to ditch jQuery.

I'd recommend having a look at something like [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) instead as that seems to be quite popular in the Eleventy community.
