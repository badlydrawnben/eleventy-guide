## Can you use Eleventy if you're crap at Javascript?
Whilst Eleventy is a Javascript-based SSG, you really don't need to know *a ton* of JS in order to get going. There's plenty Starter Projects you can pick from, and then get something up and running very quickly without needing to poke around under the hood.

If you're new to SSGs and the JAMstack then there is a learning curve. Eleventy is deliberately barebones and unopinionated â€“ that's what developers like about it. But as a newbie you don't have many opinions of your own so it can seem a bit daunting. I hope this site will help.

Udemy, Wes Bos, YouTube, edabit

Do it in parallel with Eleventy

Learning without practising not best way

Node.js DOn't need to know PHP or MySQL or Linux/Apache stuff
